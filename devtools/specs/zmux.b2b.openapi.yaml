      description: |
        Applies a JSON Merge Patch (RFC 7396) to a channel configuration.

        ### RFC 7396 behavior quick brief
        - Omitting a field → the field **remains unchanged**.
        - Setting a nullable field to `null` → the field is **cleared/removed**.
        - Setting an **object** field to `{}`:
          - If the current value is an object → **no-op** (unchanged).
          - If the field is nullable and the current value is `null` → it becomes `{}` (created).
        - Successful patches return `204 No Content` even if nothing changed.
        - Objects are merged recursively; nested fields follow the same rules.
        - Requires `Content-Type: application/merge-patch+json`.

            Indicates whether the channel is enabled — that is, whether media reading from the input source is enabled.
            When the channel is disabled, the server does not attempt to connect to the input media source.

            Note: When `enabled` is `true`, `input.url` and `name` are non-null.

    ChannelPatchRequest:
      description: |
        Subset of channel fields to update.

        - Unknown/unexpected or unauthorized properties in requests are rejected with `400 Bad Request`.
        - Undocumented additonal properties (obscured) MAY exist and vary by client authorization level.

        Field constraints
        - Credentials must be provided via `input.username` and `input.password`; 
          `input.url` MUST NOT contain RFC 3986 `userinfo` (e.g., `username[:password]@`) → **422 Unprocessable Content**.

        Cross-field constraints (evaluated **after** applying the JSON Merge Patch):
        - `enabled: true` → both `name` and `input.url` must be non-null.
        - `input.url` non-null → `name` must be non-null.
        - `input.username` non-null → `input.url` must be non-null.
        - `input.password` non-null → `input.username` must be non-null.

              description: >
                An **absolute URL** that specifies the source/destination of a multimedia stream.

                MUST follow the generic URI syntax [RFC 3986].
                MAY be further constrained or extended by the semantics of the specific protocol (scheme).

                URI syntax violations (e.g., malformed encoding, invalid structure) → `422 Unprocessable Content`.

                ### Authentication

                Provide credentials via `input.username` and `input.password`.
                `input.url` MUST NOT contain RFC 3986 `userinfo` (e.g., `username[:password]@`). Requests containing `userinfo` in `input.url` → `422 Unprocessable Content`.

                ### Protocol-Specific Notes

                - **RTSP URIs** MUST conform to [RFC 2326]. RTSP support & versioning:
                    - Supported: RTSP 1.0 (RFC 2326), including `rtsps://` (RTSP 1.0 over TLS).
                    - Not supported: RTSP 2.0 (RFC 7826).
                    - For `rtsps://`, the service forces TCP interleaving so that control and media traverse the TLS connection; if the server requires UDP under `rtsps://`, the connection fails.

                ### Access Policy (Allow/Deny Lists)

                The server MAY enforce internal allow/deny lists over schemes, hostnames, ports, or any other URI component.
                These lists MAY vary by client, tenant, or deployment. Any URI referencing a disallowed resource → `422 Unprocessable Content`.

                ### Note: Input URL & Name Dependency

                - `input.url` with `name` null (not already configured or included in this patch) → `422 Unprocessable Content`.
            username:

                ### Note: Username & Input URL Dependency

                - `input.username` with `input.url` null (not already configured or included in this patch) → `422 Unprocessable Content`.

                ### Note: Password & Username Dependency

                - `input.password` with `input.username` null (not already configured or included in this patch) → `422 Unprocessable Content`.

            Useful for pausing a channel without losing its settings.

            ### Note: Enabled & Input URL/Name Dependency

            - `enabled: true` with `input.url` null (not already configured or included in this patch) → `422 Unprocessable Content`.
            - `enabled: true` with `name` null (not already configured or included in this patch) → `422 Unprocessable Content`.

            - `true` ⇒ the server is currently reading/processing media successfully from the input source.
            - `false` ⇒ the server is **not** reading media successfully (re/connecting, network/connection issues (timeouts, auth), corrupted/unreadable media, any other errors in media reading/processing).

            Note: If `Channel.enabled` is turned off, the server does not attempt to read media — so online will always report as false.
